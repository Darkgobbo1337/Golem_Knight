You cause mini explosions to happen all around when your enemies attack you and chip off fragments of gems from your armor and shield. Whenever an enemy's attack deals more than (35%-15%) damage a fragment of a gem breaks off and explodes in their face. This deals (5-25) Infusion damage and knocks them off-balance for (1-3) turn.

Your alchemist infusions will change what damage the beam and explosion do.
