	Gem Cost: 1
	Range: 3-8
	Cooldown = 12,
	Use Speed: Spell
	You imbue a gem and throw it at your foe and it grows in flight to the size of a boulder. It deals (125-300) Infusion damage to the target and in a radius of 1 around the target. Targets hit by the boulder have a chance to be knocked back(3-9).
	The damage increases with Strength and quality of the gems used.

	Use mode = "sustained"
	Mana Cost: 25
	Cooldown: 15
	Use Speed: Spell
	Your gems in your armor become spikes that gouge and tear your opponents when they strike you. When hit in melee combat you deal (5-50) damage back to your attacker in the form of physical bleed damage.
	The damage increases with your Spellpower.

newTalent[
	name = "Warden Form",
	type = {"spell/steel-alchemy", 4},
	Use mode: Passive
	You borrow from the dwarves to become like living steel, meshing magic and nature to keep you alive. While Living Steel infusion is active you automatically block after casting a spell that uses an alchemist gem. When you block you consume an alchemist gem to heal (2-10) over 4 turns. This can stack up to five times and refreshes the duration each time.
	Also your golem gains the bonus of your Living Steel Infusion and some of your golemâ€™s talents root all targets hit dealing physical damage every turn.
	The heal and the pin damage scale with Strength.
